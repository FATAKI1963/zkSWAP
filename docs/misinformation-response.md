# Response to Misinformation and Scam Accusations

This document addresses common misconceptions and incorrect claims about zkSWAP ‚Äî especially those based on confusion with unrelated projects or surface-level assumptions.

---

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding #1: "zkSWAP is the same as ZKSwap (zks.org)"

**False.**

zkSWAP (zk-swap.com) is a **standalone, TON-native DEX project** with its own architecture, governance, and compliance model.

It is **not affiliated** in any way with:
- `zks.org`
- `ZKSwap Finance`
- `zkSwap.app`
- or any Ethereum-based zk-rollup project

We have published a clear distinction in [`faq.md`](./faq.md) and [`TON-comparison.md`](./TON-comparison.md).

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding #2: "A project that charges 1500 USDT must be a scam"

**Oversimplified.**

The **1500 USDT** fee is not a blanket charge. It is part of a **risk-based MiCA-compliant KYC process**, activated only under:

- suspicious wallet behavior
- abnormal profit patterns
- low trading history (< $50K/year)

This policy is public, documented, and aligned with **MiCA Article 68(1)(b)**.

See: [`docs/compliance/case-study.md`](./compliance/case-study.md)

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding #3: "There's no proof the platform is real"

**Incorrect.**

zkSWAP maintains full transparency:

- [Public GitHub repository](https://github.com/ton-network-dex/zkSWAP)
- [Legal documentation](https://dex-legal.gitbook.io/zkswap-documentation)
- [Medium article by TON Network](https://medium.com/@tonnetwork/zkswap-first-cross-chain-amm-dex-on-ton-with-real-compliance-aec21fc576cc)
- [Smart contract interface](./contracts/zkInterface.sol)
- [Swagger API model](./docs/api.swagger.json)

All key assets are published and traceable.

---

## ‚ùå Misunderstanding #4: "Funds are lost if payment is incorrect"

**False.**

While payments must include the correct **Payment Identifier**, zkSWAP has:

- a **manual reconciliation process**
- unmatched payments are held in a secure internal balance
- funds are returned upon sender verification

This is explained in [`faq.md`](./faq.md)

## ‚úÖ What to Do if You See Misinformation

If someone claims zkSWAP is a scam or fraudulent:

1. Ask them which domain they are referring to  
2. Confirm if they used the **official site**: [https://zk-swap.com](https://zk-swap.com)  
3. Direct them to this file and the public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ton-network-dex/zkSWAP)

### üîê Final Note

Scams rely on deception. zkSWAP relies on transparency.

If you're not sure ‚Äî ask. Our documentation is public. Our policies are strict.  
And unlike many "anonymous" DeFi projects, we publish **everything.**
