### ‚ùì What happens if I send the verification payment incorrectly?

All verification payments must include a **Payment Identifier** in the transaction comment (memo field).  
If this identifier is missing, the payment **cannot be automatically matched** and may be marked as unprocessed.

Due to the **irreversible nature of TON Blockchain transactions**, the platform is **unable to cancel or reverse the funds** once they are sent.  
However, zkSWAP maintains a proactive recovery mechanism. Any unmatched or incorrectly sent payments are **automatically rerouted to the platform's internal balance** and **flagged for manual return.**

The platform will make **every reasonable effort** to ensure that such funds are returned to the original sender upon verification.

üìå Important: Always double-check the address and include the correct identifier when making a compliance payment.
