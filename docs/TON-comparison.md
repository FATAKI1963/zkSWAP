## üîç Unique Strengths of zkSWAP

- **Legal-first DEX:** Only platform on TON with transparent regulatory stack.
- **Cross-chain LayerZero integration:** Seamless swap support across major blockchains.
- **Transparent verification flow:** No off-chain forms, only wallet analytics and smart contracts.
- **GitHub-documented stack:** Full open-source disclosure of API, contracts, and legal logic.

## üîê Why zkSWAP is Positioned Differently

STON.fi and DeDust are excellent community projects, but they operate **outside legal frameworks** and offer **no cross-chain interoperability or regulated structure**.

zkSWAP, by contrast, offers:
- Secure interaction across chains  
- Verified asset listings  
- Protection for compliant users
